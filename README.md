This repository contains a project done for Computational Thinking with Algorithms module on ATU, Ireland. The aim of the project is to write an application which will be used to benchmark five different sorting algorithms.

### HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT?
***

1. Clone this repository
2. Download [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/)
3. Download [cmder](https://cmder.net/)
4. Run the *benchmark.py*
    - NOTE: The time required for this application to run depends on the machine it is run on.

### BENCHMARK REPORT
***

The table below shows the application output. The output are average times in milliseconds calculated running each algorithm 10 times for different input sizes, in the range from 100 elements to 10 000 elements.

The graphs below show the average running times for tested algorithms. Because running times of the Simple sorting algorithms are much higher than the other tested algorithms, and it is impossible to tell the difference between the remaining algorithms, there are 2 separate graphs, the first showing all five sorting algorithms, and the second one with Merge, Quick and Counting Sort algorithms only.
